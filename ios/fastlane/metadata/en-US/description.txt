Ballard Books App is an easy way for you to sell, buy, and rent books.  We specialize in more recent books and some older editions for colleges and universities. We have options for in-person pickup and delivery in the Provo/Orem Utah area. Free shipping is also available nationwide. 
 
To sell a bookâ€¦
 
All you have to do is scan or type the ISBN of your book(s) under Sell a Book. You will immediately get a live quote. After checkout, you will either have information for in-person pickup or receive a prepaid shipping label via email with instructions on how to package your book(s). Once we receive and inspect the book(s), the balance will show in the My Wallet feature. You can then choose to withdraw and the money will get transferred to your PayPal account. 
 
We did a lot of research to make sure we are buying books competitively. With the Elite Club, members get 20% extra cash for books they are selling for a small membership fee of just $26.97 per year. Another benefit of the club is members can be a rep and make commissions just by signing people up for the app. They don't have to deal with books or payments since Ballard Books does all that. For example, if you're a rep, every time the person you signed upsells us books, you get a commission. If that person also becomes a rep then you both get a commission. To make it simple we are just doing two levels. The more you sign up the better. It's a very easy way to make extra income. 
 
We are so excited to be able to offer this service and hope to help students everywhere!
